<p>While freelancing for the start-up <a href="https://digitalinflux.com/">Digital Influx</a>, I coordinated a team of two Unity programmers (myself included) and two 3D/2D artists to create an Endless Runner game.</p>

<p>The game was designed with low-power machines in mind from the start, as the target audience were young students who would be playing the game on their school computer’s browser.</p>
<p>The game’s objective is to collect coins, avoid obstacles and answer True or False questions related to the UX Course that they could have completed beforehand, solidifying their learning.</p>

<ul>
<li>We decided from the start on a low-poly, flat shaded look.</li>
<li>There’s no lighting and all materials are using the standard Unlit URP shader.</li>
<li>The camera’s far clipping plane is very short so as to not render too many objects at once.</li>
<li>We use fog to mask objects popping in on the horizon.</li>
<li>Extensive use of object pooling was employed to re-use all possible GameObjects to simulate an infinite road.</li>
<li>Some textures were as small has 1x1px and 4x4px, so that the game would be as small as possible and would load quickly even on slow internet connections.</li>
<li>Audio-clips have a random pitch shift applied to them, to add variability without the need to include different sound files.</li>
</ul>
