At Arkadium, we have recently published our first Unity cross platform game, Journey Match. It runs on browsers, iOS and Android (apps leaving internal beta soon).
Journey Match is a re-imagining of another one of our titles: Mahjongg Dimensions, except instead of being a match 2 game, it&amp;rsquo;s now match 3!
I worked on this game from concept to release. My contributions were focused mainly on:</description>

      <description>Preparing UVs When writing a shader in ShaderToy, it is usual to prime your uvs in the following way:
vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;
this will make it so that your canvas goes from 0 to 1.
Then we recenter the coordinates, putting (0,0) in the center of the screen, and making the UVs range from -1 to 1:
v = uv * 2.0 - 1.0;
Finally, we fix the aspect ratio of the canvas:</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m refreshing my knowledge on the basics of shaders, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to combine two different effects together. Here I&amp;rsquo;m combining a stripes effect using the frac function and a Rim highlight effect to create a hologram.
Source code: Shader &amp;#34;Custom/Hollogram&amp;#34; { Properties { _RimColor (&amp;#34;Rim Color&amp;#34;, Color) = (1,1,1,1) _RimPower (&amp;#34;Rim Power&amp;#34;, Range(0.5, 8.0)) = 3.0 _LinesFrequency (&amp;#34;Lines Frequency&amp;#34;, float) = 3.0 _ProportionBetweenLines (&amp;#34;Gap Size&amp;#34;, Range(0.0, 1.0)) = 0.</description>

      <description>For an internal game jam at Arkadium, we each had to pick a word game idea and develop a prototype in 3 days.
The game I chose to develop was fairly simple, revolving around sending text messages. I got the game loop part done on the first day and spent the rest of my time polishing the screen shader for the phone.
Unity Shadergraph shader The frame around the screen is from an actual picture of the phone from wikipedia.</description>

Gameplay
How to play About the project Developed in one week as a coding challenge I grew overly fond of, this Unity game runs both on Android and on the web through WebGL. Please find the source code in the linked github repo.
There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty, but they never get too hard as you always have 5 minutes to beat each one.</description>

      <description>An Endless Runner Built In One Month While freelancing for the start-up Digital Influx, I coordinated a team of two Unity programmers (myself included) and two 3D/2D artists to create an Endless Runner game.
Your browser does not support the video tag.The game was designed with low-power machines in mind from the start, as the target audience were young students who would be playing the game on their school computer’s browser.</description>

      <description>Cubist - AR App I made this demo for the archviz firm 1825, as we wanted to break into the AR scene.
I used Unity 2019 with the AR Foundation and ARCore XR Plugin packages to build this.
You point your camera and press the main button to draw voxels in the air around you, sculpting forms with your movement.
You can try the app here: Cubist on Google Play</description>
